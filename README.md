# Getting Started

Before anything, you should create an account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get access to your own API key.

Once you have an API key, you can either fork/clone this repo, or just head over to my own github pages [weathr site](https://alejandromontalvo.github.io/weathr/).

If you're worried about your API key getting leaked/stolen, you can go ahead and make a temporary alternative key, which you can delete after you've used the site.
